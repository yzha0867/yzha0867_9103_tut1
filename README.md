# Quiz 8 ‚Äî Design & Coding Technique Research  
**Student:** Ying Zhang (550096346)
**Topic:** Thermal Imaging Technique (Ivan Pokidyshev)

## üü† Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration  
**Chosen Technique:** Thermal Imaging ‚Äî Inspired by Russian artist *Ivan Pokidyshev* (2022, Instagram series)

Ivan Pokidyshev‚Äôs thermal-imaging paintings transform human figures into glowing silhouettes within darkness, using gradients of red, orange, and yellow to represent emotion and energy.  
I am inspired by his approach of replacing physical form with visual heat and movement, and I aim to integrate this metaphor of warmth and perception into my own digital work.  
By visualising ‚Äúenergy flow‚Äù through colour transitions and luminance, this technique offers a powerful method for expressing rhythm, emotion, and abstract presence through code-based visualisation.

## üü£ Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration  
**Technique:** p5.js Pixel Brightness Mapping & Colour Gradient  

To simulate a thermal-imaging effect, I plan to use the `loadPixels()` and `map()` functions in p5.js to map pixel brightness values into a heat-colour palette ranging from red to yellow.  
This technique allows image brightness to correspond to perceived temperature, producing a soft gradient similar to thermal vision.  
It can also be extended with **Perlin noise** or **time-based variables** to create evolving colour flows that visualise shifting energy and intensity.  
This approach can be applied within group visual generation and later developed further in individual animation tasks.

### ‚úÖ Relevance to Final Assignment  
- Translates the concept of thermal imaging into programmable visual logic.  
- Combines artistic expression (colour temperature, energy, rhythm) with technical implementation (brightness mapping, gradient blending).  
- Scalable for animation using:  
  - **Time-based colour transitions**  
  - **Perlin noise for organic variation**  
  - **Audio input for reactive temperature shifts**
