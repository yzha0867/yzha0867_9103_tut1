## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration  
**Chosen Technique:** Thermal Imaging ‚Äî Inspired by Russian artist *Ivan Pokidyshev* (2022, Instagram series)

Ivan Pokidyshev‚Äôs **thermal-imaging paintings** transform human figures into glowing silhouettes within darkness, using *gradients of red, orange, and yellow* to represent emotion and energy.  
I am inspired by his approach of **replacing physical form with visual heat and movement**, and I aim to integrate this metaphor of *warmth and perception* into my own digital work.  
By visualising **‚Äúenergy flow‚Äù** through colour transitions and luminance, this technique offers a powerful method for expressing *rhythm, emotion, and abstract presence* through code-based visualisation.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration  
**Technique:** p5.js Pixel Brightness Mapping & Colour Gradient  

To simulate a **thermal-imaging effect**, I plan to use the **`loadPixels()`** and **`map()` functions** in p5.js to map pixel brightness values into a *heat-colour palette* ranging from red to yellow.  
This technique allows **image brightness** to correspond to **perceived temperature**, producing a soft gradient similar to thermal vision.  
It can also be extended with **Perlin noise** or **time-based variables** to create *evolving colour flows* that visualise shifting energy and intensity.  
This approach can be applied within **group visual generation** and later developed further in **individual animation tasks**.
