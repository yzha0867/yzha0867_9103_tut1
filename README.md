## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration  
**Chosen Technique:** Thermal Imaging â€” Inspired by Russian artist *Ivan Pokidyshev* (2022, Instagram series)

### Overview
Ivan Pokidyshev's **thermal-imaging paintings** transform human figures into glowing silhouettes within darkness, using *gradients of red, orange, and yellow* to visualise emotion and energy.

### Inspiration & Application
I am inspired by his approach of **replacing physical form with visual heat and movement**, and I aim to integrate this metaphor of *warmth and perception* into our own digital work.


By visualising **"energy flow"** through colour transitions and luminance, this technique offers a powerful method for expressing:

- *Rhythm* â€” capturing movement through colour variation.  
- *Emotion* â€” translating warmth and light into expressive gradients.  
- *Abstract presence* â€” reducing physical form into heat-based motion patterns.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration  
**Technique:** p5.js *Pixel-Based Thermal Colour Mapping*

### Concept Summary
- This coding technique recreates **thermal-imaging visuals** by mapping **pixel brightness** to a **colour gradient** that represents varying heat intensities.  
- Using p5.js functions **`loadPixels()`** and **`map()`**, it reads each pixel's brightness and converts it into an index within a custom *heat-colour palette*.  
- The resulting colours are blended smoothly with **`lerpColor()`** and redrawn using **`updatePixels()`**.  
- It reproduces *thermal-imaging aesthetics* and is **parameterised** (*resolution*, *heat range*, *intensity*), so the same pipeline can later be **animated** while keeping the group code **clean and modular**.  
- This process effectively translates *brightness* into **perceived temperature and motion**, generating **glowing gradients** that express *rhythm, emotion, and abstract presence*.
